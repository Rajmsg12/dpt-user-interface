First, climb aboard your own quad bike for an adrenaline-fueled adventure through the golden sands. Then, head to a Bedouin-style camp to participate in other activities such as sandboarding or camel riding as you enjoy traditional Arab music and dancing. A full buffet dinner is served in addition to tea, coffee, and other refreshments.</p>
